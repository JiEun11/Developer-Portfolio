I strive to go beyond mere feature implementation, focusing instead on designing scalable, stable architectures and conducting in-depth analysis to resolve the root causes of issues that impede the user experience. I firmly believe that collaborative growth and knowledge sharing are essential to a team's success, and I aim to contribute by using my technical leadership and clear communication to unlock the team's full potential.",
